Are you struggling with old, unnecessary slugs living in your WordPress site database? Over time, as your site grows and changes, old slugs can build up and slow things down. 

You also might have tried to create a post but WordPress decided to add "-2" to the slug, because the exact same slug is available in the database from an old, deleted post.

With Slugs Manager: Delete Old Permalinks, you can easily clean up your database and keep your site running smoothly.

And if you're running a WooCommerce store, you might have noticed that old slugs can accumulate even faster, especially as you add and remove products. These unused slugs can clutter your database and impact your site's performance, and that's why our plugin was created.

This plugin helps in making your website faster, while ensuring that your posts & products URLs remain optimized for better search engine rankings and a smoother user experience.

## 🚀 Main Features: FREE Version##

### 🚀 Scan Database for Old Slugs ###

In a neat interface, the plugin shows a list of all slugs that have changed, listing old slug, current slug, post title, and post type so you have a general overview of the old slugs in database

### 🚀 Remove Selected or ALL old Slugs ###

The interface allows you to select several slugs to be deleted, or all of them at once.

### 🚀 WooCommerce Products Support ###

The plugin works on different types of posts, so if you have WooCommerce store with thousands of products, the plugin will scan all products old slugs and show products that have old slugs saved in database.

### 🚀 Optimize Database & Website Speed ###

For large stores or websites with extensive content, URLs change and evolve, overtime, these old slugs accumulate, potentially cluttering the database. By efficiently managing and removing these old slugs, the plugin ensures optimal performance, especially in scenarios with thousands of URLs.

### Important SEO Note ###

Generally, WordPress creates redirects from old slugs to new slugs to maintain all links without 404 errors, this also comes with an SEO advantage since 301 redirects carry link weight (authority) from old link to new link.

Whenever you use the plugin, be careful when cleaning up all old slugs, if you need the URLs to be redirected but cleaned from the database, you can use a plugin like Rank Math, where it creates & saves redirections whenever you update a post slug, but having it enabled might prevent you from using a desired slug if it was saved as a redirect.

## ❤️ User Testimonials: See What Others Are Saying!##

> “It freakin' worked!: Leave it to WordPress to have such a crappy website building model that even after you delete old pages, the slugs/URLs/permalinks would somehow still exist somewhere in the background, disallowing you from using it for new pages. Luckily, this plugin is simple, requires the click of pretty much 1 button, and SOLVED my god-d*mn problem. THANKS!” – ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ [chriswordpressorg](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/it-freakin-worked/)

> “You may not know you need this!: If you’ve ever changed the permalink structure of your site – or just changed some of the permalink slugs on posts – you’ve got left-over junk in your WP trunk! This plugin found and eliminated 277 old permalinks from my site in about two seconds and with two clicks! Unless your WP site is brand-new, you probably need this plugin!” – ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ [markcorder](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/you-may-not-know-you-need-this/)
